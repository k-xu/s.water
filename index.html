                Jolly Rogers. When Jolly Rogers is open and I find myself there, I go out of my way to get a sandwich from Jolly Rogers diner.

                Type always felt so long & dragged out, but the one good thing about those days was going to Jolly Roger for lunch. We’d spend the whole break time to walk there & bring it back to class. The same sandwich every single week.

                Craved coffee during break time with my roommate so we walked down southwater street to wickenden Coffee Exchange. We talked about the nice view and how we didn’t want to go back (it’s what we always talk about). We took pictures together at the circle statue.

                Sometimes I get tired from work and I need a break, so I take walks to the canal steps to clear my head. I like looking at the lights while listening to music.

               I think the one with him was in january when I first like noticed he likes her or smth, and I asked him to talk to me and HE WAS PLAYING LEAGUE but he left his game and we were gonna talk in the lounge but he decided to take a walk. I'm not super sure where we ended up talking, just walked and stopped somewhere along canal, that was a lil further along. But it was a lil spot I think, might have been the circle statue. I asked him about her n stuff and like died inside. It was like a rly desperate feeling. Maybe we smoked, I think I tried to pretend I was interested in someone. We stayed there for an hour maybe, and walked back. The whole time I was like idk hurting and in denial.

               A girl from Brown fell down 3 steps at 3am and then started talking to me about life and breakups. She said she wanted to be there until the sun rises and that we were both there for the same reason. I think her name was Sara?

                We were really drunk so I grabbed him and made him run to some side of the canal and he puked into a trashcan.

               Retracing, I remember when I had a wintersession class over at the ID building. It was snowing. I was only wearing 2 layers of clothing. It was only by the time I reached the first bridge to 15 west that I realized I hate Winter…:/

               I think I realized during that walk that I kinda liked her so I was like BYE and died.
